There is a repo that maintains a master list of dependency
information. Specifically,
o) the name of the language+TF repo
o) the name of the docker image it builds (needed?)
o) the name of the docker image they are built FROM

Each language+TF repo as part of its .travis.yml script
checks that the name of the docker image it builds
(which it reads directly from the manifest.json file)
and the name of the docker image it is built FROM
(which it reads directly from the first line of its own
Dockerfile) and the name of the language+TF repo are
all recorded correctly in the master list.

Each language+TF repo, as part of its .travis.yml script
uses this master-list (eg curls it) to find what other
language+TF repos it needs to notify (since they depend on
it and it has just changed and successfully built a new image
and pushed it to dockerhub).
This finding-the-dependents functionality could be baked
into a simple docker image that the .travis.yml script uses
directly.

This means I can stick with the javascript based notification
I'm using although I should upgrade to using a POST which
the travis API v3 now allows. See
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/triggering-builds/
