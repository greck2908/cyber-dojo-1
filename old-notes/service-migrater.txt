Put a version number in the kata's manifest.json file.
Migrater can use this to quickly determine if migration is needed.
All web controller methods that accept a kata-id will initially call
migrater (passing the id). (Is there a ruby idiom for that?)
After that the code should be simpler.
No need to support different versions in the main code.

For example, a migration could to refactor
display_name: 'Java, JUnit'
to
display_names: ['Java', 'JUnit']


migrater will be microservice used only by the storer.

I envisage that the migrater will _only_ handle migrations of
katas _already_ in the katas-data-container.
There will be utility scripts to move katas on the hard disk
(not in the katas-data-container) into the katas-data-container.
Note _move_ so the kata will not be on the hard-disk afterwards.
