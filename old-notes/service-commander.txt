cli/cyber-dojo and cli/cyber-dojo.sh are a mess.
This stems from me not realizing two things...

1. docker-compose.yml and cyber-dojo.sh could be inside a
   separate docker-image whose job is to handle the cli (viz commander)
   This means I would not have to repull them after
   updating the web image. I would instead update
   the cli image and then call an 'update' method in
   that which could extract the names of all the images
   from the docker-compose.yml file.

2. handling of start-point create name --dir=DIR
   does *not* have to be done locally. Instead I could
   create a (temporary) docker volume, copy the DIR into that
   and then delegate to the cli docker-image with this
   volume mounted.

This cli docker-image could handle all the start-point related
stuff, and contain the cli/start_point_X.rb scripts

All the root cyber-dojo image has to actually do is...
o) check for update request
   pull latest cyberdojo/cli image
o) check for start-point create name --dir=DIR
   create docker-volume, copy DIR into it
o) delegate to cyberdojjo/cli image
   optionally mounting docker-volume

Aaaaah. Once cli is an image in its own right then the
volume mounting of DIR will have to happen regardless
of whether you are using Docker-Toolbox (eg OSX).
And the volume bypasses all local rights issues.

And commander can have docker-compose installed inside itself
which means that does not need to be installed on the host!

And commander can create a ram-disk and mount /tmp in it.
