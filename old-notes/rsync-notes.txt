     Copying files from old-server to new-server using rsync
     http://www.jveweb.net/en/archives/2011/01/running-rsync-as-a-daemon.html

     On the server I'm copying FROM I created /etc/rsyncd.conf
     and put the INTERNAL ip address of the machine I'm copying TO in the hosts-allow

     lock file = /var/run/rsync.lock
     log file = /var/log/rsyncd.log
     pid file = /var/run/rsyncd.pid
     [katas]
         path = /var/www/cyber-dojo/katas
         comment = cyber-dojo katas
         uid = 19661
         gid = 19661
         read only = yes
         list = yes
         auth users = jj
         secrets file = /etc/rsyncd.secrets
         hosts allow = 10.240.0.5/255.255.255.0

     Then I created an /etc/rsyncd.secrets file
     jj:password-goes-here

     Then I started the server
     $ sudo rsync --daemon

     Then on the server I'm copying to, cd to the folder where I want all the katas (00,01,etc)
     $ cd ~/katas
     $ rsync -rtv jj@104.199.4.146::katas .
     $ enter password

     Note jj is not a real user.
     Note :: has two colons
     Note katas is the [katas] from the rsyncd.conf file
