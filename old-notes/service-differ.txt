The animals individual folder contains a manifest.json file which contains
the visible_files, a straight hash of filename to contents (which includes output).
And the sandbox contains the individual visible_files too.

Once the runner service is separated off, the sandbox folders under katas/ will *not*
contain runtime files (eg .class files) they will contain *only* the visible files
(and output).

The contents of storer could be simplified and hold only the manifest file.
There is no way this can be worse than the use of git now since at present
each commit holds the manifest *and* the individual visible files.

The main impact of this is for the downloader.
It would need to recreate the git commits.
