Suppose you know the id of a kata done before runner was introduced
as a service. You can review ok. But if you hit [test] what happens?
Answer. web does not call into runner...
   if you hit [test]
     web sees request.
     web checks creation date of kata.
     if 'ended' it does not call runner.run()
     instead it populates @output explicitly and does not create a new traffic-light.
   ...
   How to not create a traffic-light in kata_controller...
   app/views/kata/run_tests.js.erb needs a new line
     var appendTestTrafficLight = function() {
       var testColour = "<%= @test_colour %>";
       if (testColour == '') { return; }  <------
   app/controllers/kata_controller.rb must not call
     @avatar.tested(delta, files, time_now, @output, @test_colour)
     if the kata has ended
